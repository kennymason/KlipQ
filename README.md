# KlipQ

KlipQ is a macOS clipboard manager. It saves the most recent 9 items of your copy history, allowing you to see or even paste them directly from KlipQ.

The application is contained in a menubar icon, which opens up into a simple menu of your copy history.

Keyboard shortcuts are available for selecting an item to paste from the open menu. Next and Previous Item options are also in the menu, for quickly switching between clipboard items.

## How to use

KlipQ is simple and easy to use. Once started up, the app will monitor your Mac's pasteboard for changes, logging them in your copy history. This is automatic.

To switch between recently copied items, simply click the menubar icon for KlipQ (looks like a paperclip) and select the item you want. You also have the option to select an item through keyboard hotkeys, or by using the "Next/Previous Item" options.

Once an item is selected, it is now copied to your computer's pasteboard. All you have to do is paste like you usually would!
